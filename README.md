# READ ME!!! 
## Overview
This repository contains two of my projects which goals are to ultimately deploy a containerized web service using AWS, Docker, GitHub Actions, and Webhooks. 

The goal is to automate imaging, pushing, and updating Docker containers for a web application for fast and easy fixes or tweaks.

## Repository Contents
- ![Project 4](https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/cicdf25-mebep5/blob/main/Project4/README-CI.md) consists of Dockerfile and workflow setup for compiling and pushing images to DockerHub.
- ![Project 5](https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/cicdf25-mebep5/blob/main/Project5/README-CD.md) consists of scripts, webhook configuration, and AWS instance setup for an automatic container updater that pulls directly from DockerHub.
