# Building a Web Service Container
This site consists of HTML/CSS with a button to go to the other page talking about me and my interests.
Since the site is not active unless my AWS instance is active, it wont resolve to the web page. But a link to it in the repository would be ![here](https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/ceg3120f25-mebep5/blob/main/Project3/web-content/index.html)

The docker file tells docker to use apaches official http server image version 2.4 and copies everything from my local machines directory into the containers apache document root. You can see the docker image ![here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mebep5/mywebsite2)
